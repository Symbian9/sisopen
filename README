WHAT SISOPEN DOES

Sisopen is a tool to list and extract the content of SIS files.
SIS files are EPOC installation files used in Symbian-based
smartphones like many S60 Nokia phones.

SYSTEMS WHERE SYSOPEN CAN RUN

Sisopen is an ANSI-C program, mainly targetted to Linux and other
Unix-like systems it can be compiled almost in every system with
a C compiler having zlib.

COMPILING SISOPEN

Just try

    make

it should compile without problem if you have zlib installed
in your system (not only the runtime, also the development
files are needed).

COMPILING WITHOUT ZLIB

Defining NOZLIB at compile time makes you able to compile without
zlib, but only file listing is available in this mode, files
can't be extracted.

In order to compile without zlib support just try

    make nozlib

USAGE

    sisopen filename.sis (in order to list .sis file content)

    sisopen -x filename.sis (extract files)

    sisopen -v filename.sis (show a lot of information about the sis file)

    sisopen -h (show a little help page)

It is possible to pass more than one file name to sisopen. Every
file is processed in the order they are given. Options don't
require to be passed in a specific position so

    sisopen -x filename.sis

is equivalent to

    sisopen filename.sis -x
